* Introduction
This is a backlog of useful ideas that can be incorporated into future versions of the contract.

** Ideas

*** Different contract structures for varying relationships
1. I need to consider different contracting models.
2. In the standard approach i am directly contracting with a single coachee
3. There needs to be a b2b contract with an employee call off
*** Guidance
1. The contracts need video and written guidance for users to review ahead of the sessions.
*** Non-binding moral Contract
A contract that is not intended to be binding but clarifying and represents the documentation of an agreed approach

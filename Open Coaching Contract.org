** Clear objectives and specific goal setting:
Establish the direction by working with the client to define their key goals.

For example, a client wants to improve their leadership skills, set measurable objectives like 'lead a team project within 6 months' or 'receive positive feedback from at least 3 direct reports.' Define what success will look like, such as achieving specific leadership milestones or improving team performance.

This approach ensures both you and your client are aligned on expectations, providing a clear path forward for progress.

** Session logistics:
Be specific about the number of your coaching sessions, their duration, how often they'll happen, and the format (online, phone, in-person).

** Roles and expectations:
Outline what you're responsible for (e.g., showing up prepared, offering guidance) and what the client is expected to do (e.g., follow through, stay engaged and committed).

** Communication boundaries
Set clear guidelines for how clients can contact you between sessions and also how to contact you to know when you're available.

** Scheduling and cancellations
Include how to book sessions, how much notice is needed to cancel or reschedule, and whether there are penalties for your clients for no-shows or last-minute changes.

** Fees and payment process
Lay out how much your services cost, when payments are due, how they should be made, and your refund policy (if applicable).


** Timeline of the coaching relationship
Clarify the overall duration of the engagement, whether it's a fixed term or ongoing, and any review or renewal points.
** Conduct guidelines
State expectations for professionalism and respectful behavior from both sides to keep your sessions productive and safe.
** Signatures and agreement
Finalize the contract with both parties' signatures and the date to confirm mutual understanding and consent.
